# Frequency-Sorter-Cpp
C++ program to sort an array based on the frequency of elements. Numbers with higher frequency appear first; if frequencies are equal, smaller numbers come first. Implemented using arrays only.

Sorts an array based on the ""frequency of elements"".  
- Higher frequency numbers come first.  
- If frequencies are equal, smaller numbers come first.  
- Implemented using ""arrays only"", no maps.

Input
- First line: integer `N` (number of elements).  
- Second line: `N` space-separated integers.  

Output
- Array sorted by ""frequency descending"" and ""value ascending"" if tie.
